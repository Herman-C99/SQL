#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?

SELECT distinct location, count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE location like '%NY%'
GROUP BY location
HAVING count(orderID)>2

SELECT sum(quantity) as quantity, product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE product like '%headphone%'
GROUP BY product

#3. What was the average amount spent per account in February? 

SELECT avg(quantity*price) as AVG_per_account
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderID=cust.order_id 
WHERE order_id <>' '
AND order_id <>'Order Id'

#4. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? 

SELECT avg(quantity) as AVG_quantity
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderID=cust.order_id 
WHERE order_id <>' '
AND order_id <>'Order Id'

#5. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
